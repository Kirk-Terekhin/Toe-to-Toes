<h1>For our sake</h1>
<h1>I will wait for you</h1>

<h1>I walk alone into the darkness</h1>
<h1>I came toe to toe and face to face with the beast</h1>
<h1>He knew me by my name, it was surprising</h1>
<h1>He knew everything about me that I despised</h1>

<h1>I have felt these colors</h1>
<h1>I have known you for so long</h1>
<h1>When we ran in circles</h1>
<h1>&nbsp;	</h1>
<h1>He had gold and he had silver</h1>
<h1>He had all the women and wine that you'd ever need</h1>
<h1>Just one thing, a prick of your finger</h1>
<h1>Spell your name in the sand and do it with your own blood</h1>
<h1>&nbsp;	</h1>
<h1>Bitten by the fangs of circumstance</h1>
<h1>Outwardâ€¦ </h1>
